## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project helped me reinforce my understanding of:

- Mobile-first design principles

- Handling image positioning without position: relative where unnecessary

- Avoiding overflow: hidden; when it affects the responsiveness negatively

- Using margin and padding effectively to create a balanced layout

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to:

- Improve my CSS layout skills with Grid and Flexbox

- Experiment more with animations and transitions

- Dive deeper into accessibility best practices

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs - Responsive Design](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/CSS_layout/Responsive_Design) - Provided useful insights into making my design responsive.
